# React Native WEBRTC CHAT APP

## Main focus of this project is using WebRTC feautures with Expo Dev Build

### I used Socket.IO for the signaling server.

### I started project with `managed expo` then change to the `dev-client`

- Chat function should be improved. (I'll do it when i find time to do it.)
- Group chat feature can be implemented.
- Build on Android.
